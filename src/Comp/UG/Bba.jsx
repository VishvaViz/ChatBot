                BBA stands for Bachelor in Business Administration and is usually a
                4-year university degree (3 years in the case of the UK and some
                other European countries), consisting of a combination of
                business-related and generic courses preparing a student for several
                different career paths. The foundation year provides students with
                an overview of different subjects within the business discipline and
                then allows them to choose an area of specialisation in subsequent
                years. Some degree programmes also allow students to choose a minor
                with a major discipline in order to provide a unique specialisation.
                For example, a BBA degree may offer a Major in Marketing with a
                minor in Media Studies.
